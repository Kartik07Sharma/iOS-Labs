## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling = 12
print("Years of schooling completed: \(schooling)")

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling = 13
print("Updated years of schooling completed: \(schooling)")

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("Yes, the code compiles because 'schooling' is declared as a variable  using 'var'. Unlike constants declare with 'let', variable can be updated after their intial assignments.")
